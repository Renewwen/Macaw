Event search and Ticket Recommendation System
 - WebSite: http://13.59.16.183/Macaw/     

Front End:
- Developed an interactive web page for users to search events and purchase tickets (HTML, CSS and JavaScript, AJAX)
- Improved personalized business recommendation based on search history and favorite records

Back End:
- Created Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses
- Used MySQL to store real business data from TicketMaster API and migrated to the NoSQL database (MongoDB) for better scalability.
- Designed algorithms (e.g., content-based recommendation) to implement business recommendation
- Deployed server-side to Amazon EC2 to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.
